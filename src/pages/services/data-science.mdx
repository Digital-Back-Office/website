approach1_text: Data science projects by starts with business analysis rather than requirement analysis. We call this business analysis, we deliberately keep it open ended at this point to allow for obnubilated insight discovery.  We start with a mind-map of all the relevant data sources, questions and insights requirements.  At the end of the process we narrow down on the data sources and the kind of exploration we would like to build. 
approach2_text: Data preparation and sourcing is important step in data science project. In this step we source both structured and unstructured  data. Data is profiled, cleansed, validated and then prepared for model building. Feature engineering  involves addition and construction of additional variables, or features, to your dataset to improve. Data preparation step involves building feature stores. 
approach3_text: Model building is the core part of data analytics and is used to extract insights and knowledge from the data to make business decisions and strategies. Model building in data  is aimed at achieving not only high accuracy on the training data but also the ability to generalize and perform well on new, unseen data. Therefore, the focus is on creating a model that can capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than simply memorizing the training data.
approach4_text: Automated Machine Learning significantly boosts the  productivity of data team, allowing them to focus on the key modelling areas that require their time and attention. Model Automation is enabler for building better models faster. Feedback from users is incorporated in the models in quick iteration as a result of automation.
