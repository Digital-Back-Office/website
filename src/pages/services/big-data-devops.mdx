hero_title: Big Data DevOps
hero_text: We deliver full range of Big Data DevOps for major cloud providers AWS, Azure and Google Cloud as well as on-prem.

p1_text: Since big data projects are more challenging, the data experts provide valuable contributions by integrating with the DevOps team throughout the software delivery pipeline. Deploying a big data platform in the cloud today is much more complicated; Things change a lot in the Hadoop ecosystem and the cloud – so teams will need specific skill sets and coordination across activities. You can’t just have a great big data team – you need a killer Data DevOps to deliver efficiently.
p2_text: The real challenge holding back production big data cloud deployments is the pervasive lack of DevOps skills for big data.

approach4_heading: Feedback and Improvements

approach1_text: We help you hire or train your existing team on required tools to run efficient data operations. This is a vital step, as without right devops team no system can function efficiently. Big Data devpos is a very specialist role that require understanding of data system, code as well as infrastructure.  We have developed well defined process for training and hiring of big data devops professionals.  
approach2_text: Build, Deploy and test infrastructure and continuous integration pipelines. We understand that data poses unique challenges to testing pipelines in lower environments, that is why we have developed a unique data development lifecycle. We build your infrastructure and pipelines on a flexible framework that we have developed after implementing many big data systems. This provides a foundation to build quality devops processes in a short time period.   
approach3_text: Monitoring and analysing system metrics help identify performance bottlenecks. This analysis may reveal issues like data skew, inefficient queries, or resource contention. By pinpointing the bottlenecks, optimizations can be made at various levels. We ensure that your multi dimensional time series are easily query-able. This helps us alert and fix the problem quickly and  ensuring that your data systems are resilient. 
approach4_text: Feedback loops play a crucial role in the world of DevOps. They provide several benefits that ensure the Data Pipelines being deployed are of high quality and produced in a timely manner.
