hero_title: Big Data Architecture
hero_text: We design secure, fault tolerant and scalable Big Data solutions that work across various departments and teams.

p1_text: Big data architecture is the foundation for big data analytics. The big data architecture framework serves as a reference blueprint for big data infrastructures and solutions, logically defining how big data solutions will work, the components that will be used, how information will flow, and security details. A good big data system is designed to handle the ingestion, processing, and analysis of data that is too large or complex for traditional database systems.
p2_text: The size of Big Data realm differs for organizations. For some, it can mean hundreds of gigabytes of data, while for others it means hundreds of terabytes. Size of data, need for advance analytics capabilities, users and the budget are some of the key factors that affect the big data architecture.

card1_heading: Code First
card1_text: We follow Data Pipelines are code, which means they are versioned and have tests. The pipeline as code model creates automated processes that drives  efficiently

card2_img: /assets/images/Services/Big Data Architecture/img2.svg
card2_heading: Data Governance
card2_text: We place Data Governance is at core of the system architecture. Data security and compliance are designed as integral part of the system and not as afterthought.  

card3_img:  ../../../assets/images/Services/Big Data Architecture/img3.svg
card3_heading: Cost Optimized
card3_text: Highly scalable, large-scale distributed clusters are typically the foundation for modern big data architectures, we build them to run and scale to save every penny.

approach2_heading: Decide Deployment Strategy
approach3_heading: Select Tooling
approach4_heading: Architecure, Design and Devops planning

approach1_text: Understand data variety, velocity, and challenges with the current system. Common use cases include data archival, process offload, data lake implementation, unstructured data processing, and data warehouse modernization. We work with various teams to model the the problem and understand the budget.
approach2_text: Deployment can be either on-premises, which tends to be more secure; cloud-based, which is cost effective and provides flexibility regarding scalability; or a mix deployment strategy. If cloud based bring an agreement on the the provider AWS, Azure or GCP.
approach3_text: Hadoop is one of the most widely recognized big data architecture tools for managing big data end to end architecture. Select from variou various Hadoop distribution, Databricks, BigInsights, Cloudera. Next select various component, orchestration tools, visualization tools etc.

approach4_text: Plan for Data Architecture, pipeline design, CICD etc to support business requirments. This also includes data security, monitoring, autoscaling, disaster recovery, data governance.
