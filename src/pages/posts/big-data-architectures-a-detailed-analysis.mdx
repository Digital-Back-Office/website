### The "Two Pipelines" Problem

For a decade, Data Engineers have suffered under the tyranny of the **Lambda Architecture**.
To get both accurate historical data and low-latency real-time data, we had to build two separate pipelines:
1.  **The Batch Layer:** Slow, accurate, comprehensive (e.g., nightly Spark jobs).
2.  **The Speed Layer:** Fast, approximate, messy (e.g., Storm/Spark Streaming).

This meant writing the same business logic twice (once in SQL, once in Java/Scala), debugging two systems, and praying they converged.

### Enter the "Kappa" and "Lakehouse" Era

At **Digital Back Office**, we advocate for a radical simplification. The modern stack allows us to treat **all data as a stream**, effectively killing the Batch Layer.

#### Key Enablers of the Unified Architecture:

1.  **Open Table Formats (Apache Iceberg / Delta Lake):**
    These formats bring ACID transactions to the data lake. You can now stream data *directly* into your lakehouse and query it with SQL immediately. No more "waiting for the partition to close."

2.  **Unified Compute Engines (Apache Flink / Spark Structured Streaming):**
    Write your transformation logic *once*. Run it in streaming mode for real-time ingestion. Run the *exact same code* in batch mode for backfilling historical data.

3.  **Decoupled Storage & Compute:**
    Store everything cheaply in S3/GCS. Spin up ephemeral compute clusters only when you need to query or process.

### Why This Matters for Business

This isn't just technical cleanup; it has massive business impact:

*   **Data Freshness:** Dashboards move from "Yesterday's Data" to "Last Minute's Data."
*   **Cost Reduction:** You stop paying for a massive Hadoop cluster that sits idle 80% of the time.
*   **Agility:** Engineers spend time building new features, not fixing "drift" between the batch and speed layers.

### The DBO Blueprint

When we modernize a client's data stack, we typically move them to:
*   **Ingest:** Kafka / Redpanda
*   **Process:** Flink (for stateful stream processing)
*   **Store:** S3 + Apache Iceberg
*   **Serve:** Trino or StarRocks (for sub-second analytics)
