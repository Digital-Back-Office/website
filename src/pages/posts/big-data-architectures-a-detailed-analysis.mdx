### The Need for Architectural Planning

Investments in Big Data solutions have been rapidly increasing, underscoring the importance of careful planning before implementation. However, many organisations face difficulties due to the lack of architectural planning for their data management solutions. Often, technology-driven solutions are developed without aligning them with business requirements, leading to inefficiencies and overlapping functionalities.

### Evolution of Big Data Architectures

Over the years, several Big Data architectures have been proposed to address the complexities of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently. Two prominent architectures, the Lambda and Kappa architectures, have gained recognition for their approaches to data processing. However, the field continues to evolve, with new architectures emerging to overcome the limitations of existing ones.

### Detailed Analysis of Big Data Architectures

**1. Lambda Architecture**

- Description: The Lambda architecture aims to achieve low-latency updates while maintaining high accuracy by employing three layers: batch, speed, and serving layers.

- Advantages: Offers better accuracy, throughput, and reliability. Provides real-time and historical data analysis capabilities.

- Drawbacks: Synchronisation between batch and speed layers can be challenging. Requires maintenance of two separate code bases.

- Use Cases: Suitable for real-time analytics, log message analysis, and systems requiring rapid feedback.

**2. Kappa Architecture**

- Description: The Kappa architecture eliminates the need for separate batch processing by enhancing the speed layer to support reprocessing of streamed data.

- Advantages: Simplifies data processing with a single code base. Allows for historical data querying and analysis through stream replays.

- Drawbacks: Limited to analytical operations, not transactional ones. Data retention period is predefined.

- Use Cases: Ideal for real-time applications and scenarios requiring continuous data processing.

**3. Microservice Architecture**

- Description: Comprises loosely coupled services that run independently and communicate via REST web services or remote calls.

- Advantages: Enables faster development, fault tolerance, and scalability. Allows services to be developed and scaled independently.

- Drawbacks: Requires complex development and inter-service communication mechanisms. Consumes higher memory compared to monolithic systems.

- Use Cases: Adopted by tech giants for handling high request volumes and complex systems.

**4. Zeta Architecture**

- Description: Integrates technological solutions directly with the business/enterprise architecture, providing containers for running and interacting with software independently.

- Advantages: Utilises hardware more efficiently. Facilitates seamless testing and deployment of applications.

- Drawbacks: Complexity in development and inter-component communication. Requires strong team coordination.

- Use Cases: Suitable for real-time data processing, complex web applications, and Big Data analytics solutions.

**5. IoT Architecture (iot-a)**

- Description: A high-level abstraction architecture designed for IoT projects, emphasising data processing and communication.

- Advantages: Tailored for smart home, smart city, and automotive applications. Facilitates real-time data processing and interaction.

- Drawbacks: Limited feedback on performance and scalability. Requires further evaluation in real-world scenarios.

- Use Cases: Deployed in smart home systems, automotive applications, and biometric databases.

### Conclusion

Big Data architecture design is essential for organisations seeking to leverage data effectively for business insights and decision-making. While several architectures exist, each offering unique advantages and challenges, there is still a lack of comprehensive review work concerning their design process. Moving forward, continued experimentation and real-world applications are needed to refine architectural choices and establish standards for efficient Big Data ecosystem development.
