### The "Demo God" Illusion

We've all seen it. A brilliant data scientist presents a demo. They type a prompt, and 5 seconds later, the AI generates a perfect marketing email. The executives cheer. Funding is approved.

Six months later, the project is dead.

Why? Because the demo ignored the **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** that govern the real world: Latency, Cost, Reliability, and Security. This is what we call **POC Purgatory**.

### The Four Horsemen of AI Failure

At **Digital Back Office**, we specialize in rescuing projects from this purgatory. Here are the four most common reasons we see AI projects fail to launch.

#### 1. The Latency Trap
*   **The POC:** Calls GPT-4 for every single step. Takes 15 seconds to generate a response.
*   **The Reality:** Users bounce after 3 seconds.
*   **The Fix:** **Cascading Inference.** Use a cheap, fast model (like Haiku or Llama 3) for simple routing tasks, and only call the "smart" (and slow) model for complex reasoning. Implement aggressive caching for semantic matches.

#### 2. The Cost Explosion
*   **The POC:** "It costs $0.03 per query. That's cheap!"
*   **The Reality:** At 100,000 queries a day, that's $3,000/day or $1M/year. The CFO kills the project.
*   **The Fix:** **Token Optimization.** We optimize prompts to reduce input tokens by 40%. We fine-tune smaller models to replace large generalist ones, often cutting costs by 90% while maintaining accuracy for the specific task.

#### 3. The "Drift" Disaster
*   **The POC:** Tested on a static dataset from last month.
*   **The Reality:** The world changes. Data formats change. User behavior changes. The model starts hallucinating or failing silently.
*   **The Fix:** **Continuous Evaluation Pipelines.** You need an "AI Judge" (another model) that automatically scores a sample of production outputs daily. If the quality score drops below a threshold, an alert is triggered.

#### 4. The Security Hole
*   **The POC:** "Just paste the customer data into the prompt."
*   **The Reality:** You just sent PII (Personally Identifiable Information) to a public API. Legal shuts you down.
*   **The Fix:** **PII Redaction Layers.** We implement middleware that detects and masks sensitive data (names, SSNs, credit cards) *before* it leaves your secure VPC.

### The DBO Production Standard

We don't just write code; we build **Systems**. Our definition of "Done" for an AI project includes:
1.  **Eval Framework:** An automated test suite that grades the AI's answers.
2.  **Rate Limiting & Fallbacks:** What happens when the API is down?
3.  **Cost Monitoring:** Real-time dashboards showing spend per user.
4.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** Workflows for flagging and correcting bad AI outputs.

### Conclusion

Moving from POC to Production isn't a data science problem; it's a **Systems Engineering** problem. It requires a shift in mindset from "experimentation" to "reliability."

If your AI project is stuck in the lab, you don't need a better model. You need better engineering.
