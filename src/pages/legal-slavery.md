### Engaging with Stakeholders to Monitor Working Conditions

**Digital Back Office Ltd** actively engages with various stakeholders to help monitor working conditions across our operations and supply chain:

- **Our Suppliers**: We maintain regular communication with our suppliers, conducting due diligence assessments and incorporating labour standards into our supplier agreements. We encourage open dialogue and collaboration to address any potential risks.

- **Workers within Organisation**: We have established channels for our employees to raise concerns or report potential issues related to working conditions, including modern slavery. This includes regular staff meetings, confidential reporting mechanisms.

- **Businesses in Industry or Sector**: We actively participate in industry forums and initiatives focused on combating modern slavery and promoting ethical labour practices. This allows us to share best practices and collaborate on solutions to common challenges.

##### Social Audits

To look for signs of forced labour, we utilise social audits within our supply chain. During the reporting period, we employed the following types of audits:

- **Audit conducted by our staff**: Our internal audit team conducted audits of key suppliers, focusing on labour practices.

- **Audit conducted by supplier’s staff**: We require some of our lower-risk suppliers to conduct self-assessments and provide evidence of their compliance with our labour standards.

- **Announced audit**: The majority of our audits are announced to allow suppliers to prepare relevant documentation and ensure appropriate personnel are available.

- **Unannounced audit**: In certain high-risk situations or for follow-up audits, we conduct unannounced audits to gain a more accurate understanding of working conditions.

##### Grievance Mechanisms

**Digital Back Office Ltd** has several grievance mechanisms in place to allow workers in our operations or supply chains to raise concerns or make complaints:

- **Using anonymous whistleblowing services, such as a helpline or mobile phone app**: We provide access to a confidential and independent whistleblowing service through a dedicated helpline and a secure mobile phone application that allows workers to report concerns anonymously without fear of retaliation. This service is available to all employees and supply chain workers.

- **Through trade unions or other worker representative groups**: We recognise and respect the role of trade unions and other worker representative groups in advocating for workers’ rights. We engage in open dialogue with these groups to address any concerns raised by workers in our operations and supply chains. We also have a dedicated email address for grievance reporting and hold regular worker forums at our operational sites.

### Modern Slavery Risks

**Digital Back Office Ltd** did not identify any modern slavery risks in its operations or supply chains during the period of this statement. We maintain a proactive approach to risk assessment and due diligence to ensure the ongoing prevention of modern slavery. Our risk assessment processes consider factors such as geographical location, industry sector, and the nature of the goods and services being procured.

### Finding any International Labour Organization (ILO) Indicators of Forced Labour

This statement does not refer to finding any ILO indicators of forced labour during the reporting period. While we did not identify any specific instances, we remain vigilant and continue to monitor our operations and supply chains for any potential signs of forced labour in line with the ILO’s indicators.

We will track these KPIs on a regular basis and use them to inform our future strategies.

- **Progress Goals for Next Statement**:
  - To increase the percentage of our high-risk suppliers who undergo unannounced audits.
