### Intended Use of Website

CARDONE CAPITAL is not a broker-dealer or placement agent. At no time does CARDONE CAPITAL offer, broker, advise, purchase, sell, or otherwise transact in securities regulated by the SEC or federal or state law. CARDONE CAPITAL does not accept, hold, or transfer cash or securities. CARDONE CAPITAL does not guarantee that a Company seeking investment will achieve any level of success or that any proposed offering will qualify under applicable federal and state securities laws.

CARDONE CAPITAL is not a personal financial advisor. CARDONE CAPITAL, whether through the website or otherwise, does not provide personal financial advice, loans or credit, banking, consumer credit ratings, credit decisions, financial products, brokerage accounts, insurance, tax advice, legal advice, or financial or legal services of any kind.

CARDONE CAPITAL does not guarantee any results to anyone. All users of the website are responsible for making their own decisions to use the website and for any activity taken on the website, including without limitation registering and making an investment or otherwise.

### User Registration

If you are accepting the Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, rather than in an individual capacity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept the Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).

Only real persons at or above the age of 18 may register for an account and use the website. Registering for an account on the website creates no commitment or obligation on the registered user to make any investment or seek any investment. All information you provide to the website must be truthful, accurate and complete in all material respects. Our registration process may use third-party validation technology, including those provided by third-party social media sites, to attempt to confirm your qualification to use the website.

Your registration and the use of any third-party site are subject to the terms and conditions and policies of such sites, and CARDONE CAPITAL is not responsible or liable for any harm resulting from the use or misuse of those sites, including when such harm could or does affect your account on this website or use of the website.

### Registered Account Obligations

### Prospective Investor Accounts

Any person or entity that is considering making an investment with a Company that posts its fundraising plans on the website, or, after the fundraising plan becomes a qualified offering, makes an investment, does so at his or her own risk. All investment carries risk that you may lose some or all of your investment. No Content on the website is a replacement for performing your own due diligence, exercising good judgement, and seeking financial, investment, tax, or legal advice from qualified and licensed professionals with knowledge of your personal circumstances. Any registered financial, legal, or tax representatives or firm working for or with CARDONE CAPITAL or communicating with you or users in general through the website are not your personal advisors and do not have knowledge about your personal circumstances, and anything they post is for informational purposes only and may not be accurate to your situation, and you agree that you shall not rely on Content on the website in making personal decisions about an investment or the potential legal, tax, or financial consequences of such investment. You are encouraged to seek personal professional advice from qualified and licensed professionals.

You are solely responsible for your investment decisions. While you may be asked about your identity, individual financial circumstance, and investment experience and sophistication during your engagement with the website, CARDONE CAPITAL and its advisors and vendors are not responsible to verify the veracity of the information that you provide, even if you certify to its truth or undergo a suitability review. Whether you are an “Accredited Investor,” as such is defined under securities law, or a non-accredited investor, or an institutional investor, CARDONE CAPITAL and the Companies seeking investment are relying on your representations with respect to your investment experience, your financial status, and your eligibility to invest. You may, further, be held personally liable for your fraud, negligence, and other bad acts that may result from any false representations you make.
