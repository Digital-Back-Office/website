  cards:
    - title: "1. The \"MVP Spaghetti\" Trap"
      description: "Speed won the market, but now fragility is losing it. Your rapid iteration has left a legacy of unmaintainable code and manual deployments. Every new feature breaks something old, and your best engineers are stuck fixing bugs instead of shipping value."
    
    - title: "2. Cloud Bill Shock"
      description: "Your AWS/GCP bill is scaling faster than your revenue. Unoptimized resources, orphaned instances, and lack of reserved capacity are burning your runway. You need to cut costs without cutting performance."

      description: "You just raised a round, but you can't deploy capital into code fast enough. Hiring is slow, and onboarding new engineers takes months because of poor documentation and complex local dev environments."
    
    - title: "4. Compliance Debt (SOC2/ISO)"
      description: "You're ready to move upmarket, but Enterprise customers demand SOC2 or ISO 27001. Retrofitting security into a chaotic startup environment is a massive distraction that stalls your sales cycle."
