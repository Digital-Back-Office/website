  heading: "The Critical Barriers Slowing Down Retail Innovation"
  cards:
    - title: "1. The \"Ghost Stock\" Epidemic"
      description: "You are losing sales because your system says \"in stock,\" but the shelf is empty. \"Phantom Inventory\" caused by disconnects between POS, ERP, and the warehouse triggers a \"death spiral\"—automated replenishment stops ordering, and your revenue for that SKU vanishes."
    
    - title: "2. The \"Swivel Chair\" Productivity Drain"
      description: "Your high-value teams spend more time copying data between screens than serving customers. This \"Manual Integration\" tax traps employees in low-value admin work, entering invoices into the ERP and re-keying them into logistics systems, killing operational speed."
    
    - title: "3. The Regulatory \"Greenwashing\" Trap (DPP)"
      description: "Vague sustainability marketing is now a legal liability. With the EU Digital Product Passport (DPP) coming in 2025, you face audit risks if you cannot cryptographically prove your supply chain origins. You need a Knowledge Graph, not just a spreadsheet, to survive the scrutiny."
    
    - title: "4. The \"One-and-Done\" Customer Churn"
      description: "You spend a fortune acquiring customers, only to lose them after one purchase. Without a Unified Customer 360 view, you treat loyal online shoppers like strangers in-store. This fragmented experience is the primary driver of churn in an omnichannel world."
