  cards:
    - title: "1. The R&D \"Re-Invention\" Tax"
      description: "Your scientists are wasting millions re-running experiments simply because they can't find previous results. \"Dark Data\" trapped in unstructured PDFs and legacy ELNs is creating a massive knowledge gap, forcing you to duplicate work while competitors race ahead."
    
    - title: "2. The \"Pajama Time\" Burnout Crisis"
      description: "Your best clinicians are quitting. For every hour of patient care, they now spend 2 hours on EHR documentation. This administrative burden is driving the \"Great Resignation,\" turning highly skilled providers into data entry clerks and risking patient safety."
    
    - title: "3. The Supply Chain \"Compliance Cliff\""
      description: "The regulatory wall is here. With the DSCSA deadline and the BioSecure Act looming, you face a perfect storm. If your supply chain lacks end-to-end digital traceability by late 2025, you face blocked contracts and immediate revenue stoppage."
    
    - title: "4. The Clinical Data \"Reconciliation Nightmare\""
      description: "Your trials are delayed by weeks—not by science, but by spreadsheets. As FDA Diversity Plans and decentralized trials explode data variety, your teams are drowning in manual reconciliation. The bottleneck isn't finding patients; it's cleaning the data to reach Database Lock."
