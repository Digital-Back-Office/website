  heading: "The Critical Barriers Slowing Down Industrial Innovation"
  cards:
    - title: "1. The \"Silver Tsunami\" Knowledge Crisis"
      description: "Your experts are retiring, taking decades of \"tribal knowledge\" with them. 11.5% of the workforce leaves annually, and junior staff are left guessing. When the manual doesn't have the answer, the answer walks out the door—unless you capture it now."
    
    - title: "2. The \"Swivel Chair\" Operational Drag"
      description: "Your high-value traders and engineers waste 20% of their day manually copying data between legacy sensors (OT) and financial systems (IT). This friction kills productivity and causes missed arbitrage windows. You can't optimize what isn't connected."
    
    - title: "3. The \"Pilot Purgatory\" Trap"
      description: "You invested millions in \"Predictive Maintenance,\" but it won't scale. Your AI works on one machine but fails across the fleet because the underlying data is siloed. Without a clean data foundation, your AI can't distinguish a sensor glitch from a bearing failure."
    
    - title: "4. The Regulatory \"Data Scramble\""
      description: "Compliance is no longer just a report; it's a data engineering challenge. New mandates like FERC Order 881 and CSRD require granular, real-time reporting. Spreadsheets can't handle this volume, leaving you exposed to fines and \"greenwashing\" risks."
