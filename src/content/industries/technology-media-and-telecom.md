  cards:
    - title: "1. The \"Swivel Chair\" Provisioning Nightmare"
      description: "Your network is fast, but your provisioning is slow. Sales and Ops teams are stuck manually copying data between screens to activate orders. This \"swivel chair\" friction causes data errors, activation delays, and \"fallout\" orders that bleed revenue."
    
    - title: "2. The \"Spreadsheet Hell\" of Royalties"
      description: "Your finance team is terrified of month-end. Calculating residuals across streaming and international channels is mathematically impossible in Excel. Reliance on fragile \"spreadsheet math\" risks million-dollar overpayments and legal disputes with talent."
    
    - title: "3. The \"Invisible Asset\" Crisis"
      description: "Your creative teams are wasting budget re-creating assets you already own. Without a Knowledge Graph, valuable images and videos are trapped in \"dumb\" storage. If you can't search by concept (e.g., \"happy family\"), the content effectively doesn't exist."
    
    - title: "4. The 5G \"Monetization Gap\""
      description: "You invested billions in 5G, but your legacy back-office can't sell it. Rigid BSS (Business Support Systems) prevent you from launching dynamic pricing for \"Network Slicing.\" You are connecting at 5G speeds but selling at 3G speeds."
