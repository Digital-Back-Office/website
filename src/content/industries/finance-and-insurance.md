    - title: "1. The 25% Onboarding Drop-Off"
      description: "Stop bleeding revenue at the final hurdle. 1 in 4 business customers abandon onboarding due to confusing processes. Manual KYC and fragmented document requests are actively pushing your hard-won clients to frictionless, digital-native competitors."

    - title: "4. The \"POC Purgatory\" Trap"
      description: "Your AI investments are failing to deliver ROI. You're stuck in \"POC Purgatory\" because 46% of AI concepts are abandoned before deployment. The problem? Your models are being built on \"zombie data\" trapped in legacy silos."
